# Enterprise Manager

A robust solution for managing and controlling remote systems in enterprise environments. This project provides unattended access and task execution capabilities while maintaining system stability through a multi-tiered monitoring approach.

## Overview

The Enterprise Manager uses a three-tier architecture to ensure reliable operation:

```
Tier-1 Core (Guardian)
      │
      ├─► Tier-2 Core (Monitor)
              │
              ├─► Main Process (Executor)
                      │
                      ├─► Tasks from Control Server
```

### Components

#### 1. Tier-1 Core (The Guardian)
- The most stable and reliable component
- Rarely needs updates
- Monitors and restarts Tier-2 if it fails
- Acts as the system's last line of defense

#### 2. Tier-2 Core (The Monitor)
- Updatable component that watches the main process
- Can receive updates more frequently
- Protected by Tier-1 Core
- Restarts the main process if it fails

#### 3. Main Process (The Executor)
- Handles actual task execution
- Fetches commands from the control server
- Reports execution results back
- Protected by Tier-2 Core

#### 4. Control Server
- Central management point
- Distributes tasks to systems
- Collects execution results
- Maintains system status

## How It Works

1. The system starts with Tier-1 Core, which launches and monitors Tier-2 Core
2. Tier-2 Core starts and monitors the Main Process
3. Main Process connects to the Control Server and waits for tasks
4. When tasks arrive, they are executed and results are reported back
5. If any component fails, its monitor will restart it automatically

This design ensures that the system can:
- Recover from failures automatically
- Execute tasks reliably
- Maintain connection with the control server
- Update components safely
- Report execution status

## Use Cases

- Remote system management
- Automated task execution
- Kiosk management
- Unattended system maintenance
- Enterprise-wide command execution
- System monitoring and reporting

## Security

The system includes basic security measures like:
- Whitelisted commands only
- Process isolation
- Controlled execution
- Error containment

For production use, additional security measures should be implemented based on specific requirements.
